While we use much of Normalize within our <strong>reset.less</strong>, we have removed some elements specifically for Bootstrap.":"","Default grid system":"","Live grid example":"","The default Bootstrap grid system utilizes <strong>12 columns</strong>, making for a 940px wide container without <a href=\"#responsive\">responsive features</a> enabled. With the responsive CSS file added, the grid adapts to be 724px and 1170px wide depending on your viewport. Below 767px viewports, the columns become fluid and stack vertically.":"","Basic grid HTML":"","For a simple two column layout, create a <code>.row</code> and add the appropriate number of <code>.span*</code> columns. As this is a 12-column grid, each <code>.span*</code> spans a number of those 12 columns, and should always add up to 12 for each row (or the number of columns in the parent).":"","Given this example, we have <code>.span4</code> and <code>.span8</code>, making for 12 total columns and a complete row.":"","Move columns to the left using <code>.offset*</code> classes. Each class increases the left margin of a column by a whole column. For example, <code>.offset4</code> moves <code>.span4</code> over four columns.":"","To nest your content with the default grid, add a new <code>.row</code> and set of <code>.span*</code> columns within an existing <code>.span*</code> column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to the number of columns of its parent.":"","Live fluid grid example":"","The fluid grid system uses percents instead of pixels for column widths. It has the same responsive capabilities as our fixed grid system, ensuring proper proportions for key screen resolutions and devices.":"","Basic fluid grid HTML":"","Make any row \"fluid\" by changing <code>.row</code> to <code>.row-fluid</code>. The column classes stay the exact same, making it easy to flip between fixed and fluid grids.":"","Fluid offsetting":"","Operates the same way as the fixed grid system offsetting: add <code>.offset*</code> to any column to offset by that many columns.":"","Nesting with fluid grids is a bit different: the number of nested columns should not match the parent's number of columns. Instead, each level of nested columns are reset because each row takes up 100% of the parent column.":"","Provides a common fixed-width (and optionally responsive) layout with only <code>&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;</code> required.":"","Create a fluid, two-column page with <code>&lt;div class=\"container-fluid\"&gt;</code>&mdash;great for applications and docs.":"","Enabling responsive features":"","Turn on responsive CSS in your project by including the proper meta tag and additional stylesheet within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your document.
